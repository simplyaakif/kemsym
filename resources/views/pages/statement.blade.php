                    <p>The reason we embarked on this project is that we have observed that peopleâ€™s identities and documents are harder to be verified and authenticated by institutions and companies which offer services to these individuals. At best institutions do their verification, validation and document authentication In-House and this exposes these companies to a lot of risk such as individuals using fake documents and identities to acquire services by these institutions. This exposes these companies to a lot of liabilities than they will want to assume.
                        <br><br>
                            Kemmet System will help these companies to mitigate, eliminate and avoid these risk and liabilities by authenticating their clients and applicants before they offer services to them.</p>
